## Introduction
This project aims to recognize faces using L2-regularized least squares for classification tasks. The dataset includes 400 images of faces, split into training and test sets.

## Preparation

### Setting up
Import the necessary functions and libraries, load the data, and visualize the dataset to understand its structure and content.

### Visualising the dataset
Observe the faces stored in a data matrix using visualization functions to display single and multiple face examples.

### Splitting into the train and test sets
Normalize pixel values and partition the data into training and test sets, ensuring an appropriate split for training and evaluation.

## Approach

### Data Preparation
- Load data and labels using custom functions.
- Normalize pixel values to [0, 1].
- Partition data into training and test sets with a 5:5 split per subject.

### Model Training
Implement L2-regularized least squares (L2-RLS) for multi-class classification, with a focus on selecting the best lambda value through hyperparameter selection.

### Evaluation
- Evaluate model accuracy using a confusion matrix.
- Visualize correctly and incorrectly classified faces.

## Future Work
- Expand the dataset for better robustness.
- Develop a real-time face recognition system.
- Explore advanced architectures and techniques like transfer learning.
