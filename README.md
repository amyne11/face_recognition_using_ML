# Face Recognition System

This Jupyter notebook showcases a robust face recognition system that leverages both deep learning and linear modeling techniques. The purpose is to demonstrate a full workflow encompassing data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and result visualization.

## Features

- **Data Handling**: Efficiently load and preprocess image data to prepare it for modeling.
- **Model Training**: Utilize advanced machine learning techniques, including convolutional neural networks for feature extraction and linear models for prediction.
- **Performance Evaluation**: Implement various metrics to assess the accuracy and efficiency of the face recognition models.
- **Visualization**: Use Matplotlib and other visualization tools to display model performance and error analysis.

## Technologies Used

- **Python 3.x**: For scripting and model development.
- **Libraries**: NumPy for numerical operations, Matplotlib for visualization, and TensorFlow/PyTorch for building and training neural network models.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Provides an interactive environment for executing Python code, visualizing data, and immediate result display.
